        Authorized COVID-19 vaccines can help protect you from COVID-19. You
        should get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can. Once you are fully
        vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had
        stopped doing because of the pandemic.

        If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a
        mask in indoor public places.

        Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie
        theaters puts you at higher risk for COVID-19. Avoid indoor spaces that
        do not offer fresh air from the outdoors as much as possible. If
        indoors, bring in fresh air by opening windows and doors, if possible.
      </li>

        Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
        especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your
        nose, coughing, or sneezing.

        appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make
        masks as effective as possible.
